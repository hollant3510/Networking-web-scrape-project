PART TWO
WARNING:
1. Do not abuse the web server, your script should pace the requests
generously. One+ second(s) between requests is mandatory. Because a
large number of requests can be generated by your Python scripts by
mistake, your Python script is prohibited to put any click() or get()
function inside ANY loop. A violated submission will get grade 0.

2. Do NOT share your username and password with anyone, including your
partner. Whenever you need to share the code with your partner, remove 
your username and password from the script!!!! If you and your team-mate
have to sit side-by-side and debug the code, you can change your password
to a temporary one, change it back later.

The second part of this project is to search courses on PAWS. We want to simplify
the searching process in PAWS. The goal is to run a Python script. This script
opens the browser and automatically clicks links and fills forms, collects the
results from PAWS, and presents the consolidated data. Ideally, the whole process
takes seconds in a normal networking condition.

Selenium (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io ) is a powerful and user-friendly
tool to automate web browsing. In other words, you can write a Python script that
automatically browse certain website. Automated web browsing is widely used by
industry to test website, collect data from website. Many companies developed their
own web browsing software. There are quite a lot of tools supporting web browsing
(https://github.com/dhamaniasad/HeadlessBrowsers ), Selenium is one of them. In
the second part of this project, we use Selenium to search course on PAWS.

To finish this part of the project:

1. Install selenium on your computer.

2. Read the sample code “paws.py”, which use multithread. This script can create
different threads for different accounts. In this project, we use only one
account username/password and create one thread.

3. While working with part of the project, you will use xpath to search certain
contents in the HTML files. To get an idea of xpath, please look at the
introduction at https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html .

4. To process the results returned from web server, beautifulsoup
(https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/ ) can be extremely helpful. In this
project, when you consolidate the data and prepare the result of the project,
beautifulsoup can significantly reduce the workload. To get a quick start with
beautifulsoup, take a look at the following tutorial.
(https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/ ). To practice
beautifulsoup, you can run Python in a terminal, and copy & paste the
following lines into Python.

>>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
>>> html = """
... <html>
... <body>
... <table>
... <table id="table1">
... <th><td>column 1</td><td>column 2</td></th>
... <tr><td>value 1</td><td>value 2</td></tr>
... </table>
... <table id="table2">
... <th><td>column 1</td><td>column 3</td></th>
... <th><td>column 1</td><td>column 4</td></th>
... </table>
... </table>
... </body>
... </html>
... """
>>> soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
>>> tables = soup.findChildren('table', id="table2")
>>> my_table = tables[0]
>>> rows = my_table.findChildren(['th', 'tr'])
>>> for row in rows:
... cells = row.findChildren('td')
... for cell in cells:
... value = cell.string
... print("The value in this cell is %s" % value)

5. Modify the script so that it one particular course such as CSC230 in the current
semester. Your script should print out the Open Sections, then Closed Sections.
For example, to search CSC220. You type the following command in terminal:
python3 paws.py csc 220

 The returned result is:
Opening...
send username
jli login in process...
jli login succeed

If you search BIO330, the command and result looks like the following printout.
python3 paws.py BIO 330
Opening...
send username

jli login succeed
======= No Match =========
By default, the script searches the Fall semester of 2019. When you write the
searching part of the script, use the following picture as reference.
